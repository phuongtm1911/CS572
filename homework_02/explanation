1. We want sometimes to use setImmediate instead of using setTimeout 
because we want a callback to run at check phase of the event loop after IO events' callbacks.

2. The difference between process.nextTick and setImmediate is that process.nextTick is not part of the event loop, it adds the callback into the nextTick queue.
Node processes all the callbacks in the nextTick queue after the current callback operation completes and before the event loop continues.
It runs before any additional I/O events or timers fire in subsequent ticks of the event loop.
On the other hand, setImmediate will schedule a callback to run at check phase of the event loop after IO events' callbacks.

The function removeNum affects the event loop because it is executed asynchronously. 
When the Promise object is fulfilled, it will add its callback to the callback queue. 
When the stack is empty, it will push this callback in the stack.

All the functions are asynchronous because the fetch api makes asynchronous call and returns a Promise.

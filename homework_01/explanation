The function removeNum affects the event loop because it's executed asynchronously. When the promise object is fulfilled,
it will add its callback to the callback queue so when the stack is empty, it will call this callback from the queue and 
put it in the stack.

All the functions are asynchronous because the fetch api makes the calls asynchronous, as well as the other two, 
when using async and await, and reactive programming

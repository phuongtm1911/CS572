The function we just wrote will affect the event loop because it's executed asynchronously which means when until the promise object is fulfilled,
it will add it's callback to the callback queue so when the stack is empty, it will call this callback from the queue and put it in the stack

all the functions implemented are asynchronous functions because for the fetch api makes the calls asynchronously, as well as the other two, when using async and await, and observable operators
